<h1>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Project Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we are tasked with conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for an application that is managed and deployed through a series of automated processes. The key tools and technologies used in this workflow include Jira, Jenkins, Selenium IDE, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.
</p>

<button class="collapsible">1. Jira: Project Management and Test Planning</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Jira is used as the central platform for managing the project, where all the test plans, user stories, and test cases are documented. Specifically, we have 42 test cases listed in Jira, which need to be executed as part of the User Acceptance Testing by the deadline. Jira acts as the source of truth for tracking the status of each test case, whether it’s “To Do,” “In Progress,” or “Completed.”
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">2. Selenium IDE: Test Execution</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Selenium IDE is a browser-based tool used to automate the execution of these test cases. We were provided with a <code>.side</code> file, which contains the scripts for automated testing. We use Selenium IDE to load and execute these scripts directly in the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, not all test cases run smoothly in Selenium IDE. Some tests pass, while others fail. This suggests that while we can run tests manually through Selenium IDE, the organization primarily uses a more advanced, automated process for managing test executions and results.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">3. Jenkins: Continuous Integration and Automation</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Jenkins is the automation server that orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the application. While we manually execute some tests in Selenium IDE, the organization’s primary testing pipeline is automated through Jenkins.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jenkins is set up to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trigger automated test runs: Jenkins pulls the test cases from a repository, likely a version control system like Git, and automates their execution.</li>
        <li>Integrate with Selenium tests: Jenkins may execute the Selenium tests as part of the build process, automatically triggering the <code>.side</code> files or other test scripts. It handles the execution without needing manual intervention.</li>
        <li>Build and package the application into a Docker container.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">4. Docker: Containerization</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Jenkins packages the application and test results into Docker containers. A Docker container is a standardized unit of software that bundles the application code with all its dependencies, making it portable and easy to run on any platform. The Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry (like Docker Hub or a private registry), from where it can be deployed.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">5. Kubernetes: Orchestration and Scaling</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Once the application is containerized, it is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS. Kubernetes handles the orchestration of the Docker containers, ensuring they are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deployed correctly across multiple servers (nodes).</li>
        <li>Scaled up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.</li>
        <li>Monitored and managed automatically, restarting any failed containers to ensure high availability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Kubernetes allows the organization to efficiently manage the application’s infrastructure, ensuring the system can scale to meet user demand while running reliably on AWS.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">6. AWS: Cloud Infrastructure</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        The entire environment is hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services), which provides the underlying cloud infrastructure to run Kubernetes. AWS offers the scalability, performance, and reliability needed for the application to operate efficiently.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Understanding Pipeline Stages in Blue Ocean</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Pipeline stages are the steps that show the different phases a software goes through in the CI/CD process. The green boxes you see in Blue Ocean indicate that these stages have been completed successfully. Let me explain in more detail what these mean:
    </p>

    <h3>What is a Pipeline?</h3>
    <p>
        A pipeline is an automated process in software development. During software development, there are several steps involved:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> Jenkins retrieves the latest code from a version control system like GitHub or another source.</li>
        <li><strong>Build Stage:</strong> The code is built into a runnable form. For example, it is compiled or packaged into a Docker image.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Stage:</strong> Tests are run to verify the correctness of the code (using tools like Selenium, JUnit, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> If the tests pass, the code is deployed (for example, to a web server or a Kubernetes cluster).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        All of these steps happen in a specific sequence within a pipeline.
    </p>

    <h3>Pipeline Stages</h3>
    <p>
        Pipeline stages are the steps mentioned above. For example, when Jenkins is building a project, the steps might include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Checkout:</strong> Retrieving the code from the version control system.</li>
        <li><strong>Build:</strong> Compiling or packaging the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Test:</strong> Running the tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Deploy:</strong> Deploying the code to an environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each of these steps is called a stage in Jenkins, and in Blue Ocean, these stages are visualized as boxes.
    </p>

    <h3>What Do the Green Boxes Mean?</h3>
    <p>
        The green boxes you see in the Blue Ocean interface show that each stage has been successfully completed. Each box represents a stage, and the green color indicates that the stage was executed without any issues.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> The stage was completed successfully.</li>
        <li><strong>Red:</strong> The stage failed. This means there was an error, and the pipeline stopped at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue (or yellow):</strong> The stage is currently running, and the pipeline is progressing through this step.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For example, if a stage called “Test” passes successfully, it will appear as a green box. If there’s an issue during the test phase, the box will turn red.
    </p>

    <h3>What Are Logs For?</h3>
    <p>
        When you click on each box, a log opens that shows what happened during that stage. Logs provide detailed information about what each stage did in the background. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How the code was compiled during the build stage.</li>
        <li>Which tests were run during the test stage and details about any failed tests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If a stage fails (the box turns red), the logs will show you what went wrong, allowing you to identify and fix the issue.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Are Pipeline Stages Important?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tracking Steps:</strong> Each stage is part of the software’s development, testing, and deployment process. By tracking these stages, you can see exactly where you are in the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> If a stage fails (red box), you can immediately see where and why something went wrong. Logs provide detailed insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Success Tracking:</strong> The green boxes show you that everything is running smoothly and the pipeline is succeeding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Green boxes:</strong> Indicate that the pipeline stages were successfully completed.</li>
        <li><strong>Pipeline stages:</strong> Represent the different phases of the software development process (e.g., fetching code, building, testing, deploying).</li>
        <li><strong>Logs:</strong> Provide detailed information about each stage, showing errors and results you can use to troubleshoot.</li>
    </ul>
