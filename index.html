        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we are tasked with conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for an application that is managed and deployed through a series of automated processes. 
            The key tools and technologies used in this workflow include Jira, Jenkins, Selenium IDE, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Jira: Project Management and Test Planning</h2>
        <p>
            Jira is used as the central platform for managing the project, where all the test plans, user stories, and test cases are documented. 
            Specifically, we have 42 test cases listed in Jira, which need to be executed as part of the User Acceptance Testing by the deadline.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Selenium IDE: Test Execution</h2>
        <p>
            Selenium IDE is a browser-based tool used to automate the execution of these test cases. 
            We use Selenium IDE to load and execute scripts directly in the browser. Some tests pass, while others fail, indicating the need for more advanced automation.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Jenkins: Continuous Integration and Automation</h2>
        <p>
            Jenkins is the automation server that orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the application. 
            It triggers automated test runs, integrates with Selenium tests, and builds and packages the application into a Docker container.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Docker: Containerization</h2>
        <p>
            Docker is used to package the application and its dependencies into containers, making it portable and easy to run across any environment. 
            Jenkins packages the application and pushes the Docker images to a registry, ready for deployment.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Kubernetes: Orchestration and Scaling</h2>
        <p>
            Kubernetes handles the orchestration and management of Docker containers, ensuring that they are deployed across multiple nodes, scaled based on demand, and maintained for high availability.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. AWS: Cloud Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
            The entire application is hosted on AWS, providing the scalability, performance, and reliability needed to run the application. 
            Kubernetes runs on AWS, leveraging its infrastructure to scale and manage the application efficiently.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Blue Ocean: A Better Jenkins Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Blue Ocean is a modern and user-friendly interface for Jenkins pipelines. It offers visual pipeline management, step-by-step troubleshooting, and an intuitive UI that makes it easier to manage complex CI/CD pipelines.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Pipeline Stages Explained</h2>
        <p>
            In Jenkins, pipelines consist of multiple stages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Checkout:</strong> Pulls the latest code from a version control system like GitHub.</li>
            <li><strong>Build:</strong> Compiles or packages the code, often into a Docker image.</li>
            <li><strong>Test:</strong> Runs automated tests to ensure the quality of the code.</li>
            <li><strong>Deploy:</strong> Deploys the code to a production environment, such as a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Blue Ocean visualizes these stages as green, yellow, or red boxes, indicating success, in-progress, or failed stages.
